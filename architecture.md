# Data Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

The Porygon Pipelines project implements a modern data pipeline architecture using Google Dataform, following dimensional modeling best practices and the medallion architecture pattern.

## Pipeline Layers

### 1. Source Layer (`sources/`)

The source layer connects to external data sources and provides the raw data foundation:

#### The Look E-commerce Dataset
- **events**: User interaction events (page views, purchases, cart additions)
- **orders**: Order information and status tracking  
- **products**: Product catalog with categories and brands
- **users**: Customer demographics and registration data
- **inventory_items**: Product inventory and availability
- **order_items**: Line-item details for each order

#### Configuration Sources
- **country_lookup**: Country code mappings and geographic data
- **user_segments**: Customer segmentation rules and definitions

### 2. Intermediate Layer (`intermediate/`)

The intermediate layer applies business logic and creates clean, standardized datasets:

#### Dimension Tables
- **users_dim**: Customer master data with demographics and segmentation
- **products_dim**: Product master data with categories, brands, and attributes  
- **orders_dim**: Order header information with calculated metrics
- **inventory_dim**: Inventory tracking with availability status

#### Fact Tables
- **events_fct**: Cleaned and enriched user interaction events
- **trx_fct**: Transactional fact table with sales, costs, and profit calculations

### 3. Reporting Layer (`reporting/`)

Purpose-built views optimized for business intelligence tools:

#### Looker Studio Views
- **profit_view**: Aggregated profit analysis by various dimensions
- **profit_matrix_view**: Cross-tabulated profit analysis for matrix reporting

## Data Flow

```
Raw Sources → Intermediate Processing → Reporting Views → Business Intelligence
     ↓               ↓                        ↓                    ↓
 External APIs   Data Cleaning         Aggregations        Dashboards
 Public Datasets  Business Rules       KPI Calculations    Reports
 File Uploads     Quality Checks       Denormalization     Analytics
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Sources**: Data ingestion and connection management
- **Intermediate**: Business logic and data quality
- **Reporting**: Presentation and aggregation

### 2. Incremental Processing
- Dataform's incremental materialization for efficient processing
- Proper handling of late-arriving data
- Optimized for BigQuery's strengths

### 3. Data Quality
- Built-in data quality checks and assertions
- Automated testing at each layer
- Clear error handling and monitoring

### 4. Documentation
- Self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- Automated documentation generation
- Data lineage tracking

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Google Dataform**: SQL-based data transformation framework
- **Google BigQuery**: Cloud data warehouse for storage and compute
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Cloud infrastructure and services

### Supporting Tools
- **Looker Studio**: Business intelligence and visualization
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **YAML**: Configuration management

## Performance Optimizations

### BigQuery Optimizations
- Partitioned tables for time-based data
- Clustered tables for frequently filtered columns
- Materialized views for complex aggregations

### Dataform Best Practices
- Incremental materializations to reduce compute costs
- Proper dependency management
- Efficient SQL patterns and joins

## Monitoring and Operations

### Data Quality Monitoring
- Automated data quality checks
- Alerting for data anomalies
- Historical data quality tracking

### Performance Monitoring
- Query performance tracking
- Cost optimization monitoring
- Resource utilization analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Real-time streaming data integration
- Advanced ML-based data quality checks
- Expanded geographic data coverage
- Additional business intelligence integrations

### Scalability Considerations
- Multi-region deployment capabilities
- Enhanced security and compliance features
- Advanced data governance workflows
