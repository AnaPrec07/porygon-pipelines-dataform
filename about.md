# About This Project

## Project Overview

**Porygon Pipelines** is a comprehensive data engineering project that demonstrates modern data pipeline development using Google Dataform. The project transforms raw e-commerce data from Google's public "The Look" dataset into clean, analyzable data marts suitable for business intelligence and analytics.

## Why This Project?

This project showcases several key data engineering concepts and best practices:

### Modern Data Stack
- **Cloud-native architecture** using Google Cloud Platform
- **SQL-first approach** with Dataform for maintainable transformations  
- **Version-controlled data pipelines** with Git integration
- **Automated documentation** and data lineage tracking

### Data Engineering Best Practices
- **Dimensional modeling** with proper fact and dimension table design
- **Layered architecture** separating sources, business logic, and presentation
- **Data quality assurance** with built-in testing and validation
- **Performance optimization** for cloud data warehouses

### Business Value
- **Ready-to-use analytics** with pre-built reporting views
- **Scalable architecture** that can handle growing data volumes
- **Cost-effective processing** using BigQuery's serverless model
- **Self-service analytics** enabling business users to explore data

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Patterns
- **Medallion Architecture**: Bronze (sources) → Silver (intermediate) → Gold (reporting)
- **Star Schema**: Dimensional modeling with fact and dimension tables
- **Incremental Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Data Lineage**: Complete traceability from source to report

### Data Quality Features
- Automated data validation and testing
- Primary key uniqueness checks
- Referential integrity validation
- Data freshness monitoring
- Null value validation for critical fields

### Performance Optimizations
- BigQuery-optimized SQL patterns
- Proper table partitioning and clustering
- Incremental materializations
- Efficient JOIN strategies

## Dataset: The Look E-commerce

The project uses Google's public "The Look" e-commerce dataset, which provides:

- **Realistic e-commerce data** with customers, orders, products, and events
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** across time, geography, products, and customers
- **Complex business scenarios** including returns, inventory management, and customer behavior
- **Rich event data** for user journey analysis

### Key Metrics Delivered
- Revenue and profit analysis by multiple dimensions
- Customer lifetime value and segmentation
- Product performance and inventory optimization
- Geographic sales patterns and trends
- User behavior and conversion funnels
